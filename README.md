# Travelling-salesman-problem
Travelling salesman problem of genetic algorithm

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the challenge of finding the shortest yet most efficient route for a person to take given a list of specific destinations. It is a well-known algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research.

### NP(Nondeterministic Polynomial)
In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of the TSP (where given a length L, the task is to decide whether the graph has a tour of at most L) belongs to the class of NP-complete problems.
